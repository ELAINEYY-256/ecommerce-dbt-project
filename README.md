# ðŸ›’ E-commerce dbt Project

This project uses **dbt (data build tool)** to transform raw e-commerce data into analytics-ready models.  
It covers core business entities such as **customers, products, stores, employees, suppliers, orders, and order items**, and organizes them into **fact** and **dimension** tables for analysis.  

## With this setup, you can easily answer key business questions like:
- Who are the top customers by revenue?
- Which products drive the most sales?
- How do sales trends vary across stores and time?
